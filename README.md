#2 Согласно gitignored в директории terraform будут применяться правила исключения:
1. Local .terraform directories
2. .tfstate files
3. Crash log files
4. Exclude all .tfvars files, which are likely to contain sensitive data, such as
password, private keys, and other secrets. These should not be part of version
control as they are data points which are potentially sensitive and subject
to change depending on the environment.
5. Ignore override files as they are usually used to override resources locally and so
are not checked in
6. Include override files you do wish to add to version control using negated pattern
7. Include tfplan files to ignore the plan output of command: terraform plan -out=tfplan
8. Ignore CLI configuration files
